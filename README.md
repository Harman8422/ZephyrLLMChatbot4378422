An example chatbot using [Gradio](https://gradio.app), [`huggingface_hub`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.22.2/en/index), and the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).
This project is a chatbot interface designed to simulate the role of an Extreme Weather Phenomena Analyst. The chatbot gathers and analyzes meteorological data from diverse sources, including satellite imagery, weather stations, and radar systems. It interprets complex weather patterns and phenomena such as hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and blizzards to understand their causes and potential impacts.
